# Modelling-the-Michelson-Interferometer-in-Python
I modelled an Michaelson Interferometer in Python. First step is to get the ideal intensity for a single wavelength. Second is to model the visibility into the intensity plot. The end result is an interferometer whose fringes disappear once the path difference reaches the coherence length
