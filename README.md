# Modelling-the-Michelson-Interferometer-in-Python
I modelled an Michaelson Interferometer in Python. First step is to get the ideal intensity for a single wavelength. Second is to model the visibility into the intensity plot. The end result is an interferometer whose fringes disappear once the path difference reaches the coherence length
# Abstract
This report presents a detailed study on the modeling of a Michelson Interferometer, with
a particular emphasis on how real-world light sources characterized by finite spectral band
width—affect the resulting interference pattern. The report begins by detailing the setup and
working of the Michelson Interferometer, followed by study of the concept of coherence, both
temporal and spatial, which plays a critical role in the formation and visibility of interference
fringes. The concept of partial coherence is discussed in the context of realistic optical sources.
The third section of the report focuses entirely on the algorithm of the interferometer model
using Python. This simulation provides valuable insights into the relationship between coher
ence properties and interference behavior in practical optical systems. In the final section of
the report Coherence length and hence the spectral purity of a give source is determined.
