# Abstract
This report presents a detailed study on the modeling of a Michelson Interferometer, with a particular emphasis on how real world light sources—characterized by finite spectral bandwidth—affect the resulting interference pattern. The report begins by detailing the setup and working of the Michelson Interferometer, followed by study of the concept of coherence, both temporal and spatial, which plays a critical role in the formation and visibility of interference fringes. The concept of partial coherence is discussed in the context of realistic optical sources. The third section of the report focuses entirely on the algorithm of the interferometer model using Python. This simulation provides valuable insights into the relationship between coherence properties and interference behavior in practical optical systems. In the final section of the report Coherence length and hence the spectral purity of a give source is determined.
